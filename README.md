and the list of languages goes on.

If you want to find which languages have shortcuts for many groups of items, you can enter something like this:

The output will show only those languages which have shortcuts for both groups of items.

All the shortcuts given are limited to 2 characters.

If a language shows up as a bunch of question marks, try running the program on visual studio code or some other programming thing I don't really know

If an item is invalid, make sure it is spelled the same way you would see it written in your minecraft inventory. It should be a singular item, not plural.

If you have suggestions or ideas for what to add to this, or questions on how it works, please dm me on discord @shnenanigans.

Something similar to this was made by Matthew Bolan, however it is a mod and is limited due to hashing order. His is found here https://github.com/mjtb49/LanguageOptimizer
